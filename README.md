## Projects:
- 1. 🏃 Stickman's Adventure (Link: https://hub.kodland.org/en/project/285636)
-  The game is actually not so original by idea, but I spent lots of time on this one.
- What is the game about? The game is about a stickman where he needs to jump or crawl throught the obstacles (A fireball and a firearrow.) Once he gets to the end, there's Level 2 : The Forest. The obstacles fire is more bigger and it changes color to purple from orange. The obstacles are moving a bit faster now and in Level 2, after you crawl and jump all the obstacles and get to the house on the Level - You Win!
